* tmux-theme-override

Override/add to status-right & status-left even with a theme

I created this plugin because I wanted to have  [[https://github.com/MunifTanjim/tmux-mode-indicator][tmux-mode-indicator]] working inside of [[https://github.com/wfxr/tmux-power][tmux-power]] theme. I needed some kind of mecanism to modify status-right after tmux-power has been initialized (and set status-right) but before tmux-mode-indicator has been initialized, because else the expression "#{tmux_mode_indicator}" in status-right would never get expanded.

This plugin allows that by providing additional variables to be set:
- @tto-status-right-append-right

(add more later when needed, the basic mechanism is here ready to be expanded)

Using tpm, make sure that the following order is respected in .tmux.conf:
#+begin_src bash
set -g @plugin 'wfxr/tmux-power' # Theme first
set -g @plugin 'Percee/tmux-theme-override' # Load after theme and before plugins specific to your use case
set -g @plugin 'MunifTanjim/tmux-mode-indicator' # Load after tmux-theme-override, example plugin specific to my use case

# Then set tmux-theme-override variables
set -g @tto-status-right-append-right ' #{tmux_mode_indicator}'
#+end_src
